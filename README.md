## 2022 NASA Hackathon Website
  This project is a 48 hour coding challenge presenting the research and data gathered by my team "The Endurance". This hackathon was hosted by NASA, we entered in the gobal event as well as a local even in Belem, Brazil. The project was done in a group of 6, with my main responsibility being building a website to present the data gathered from my team.

## My contribution
The "tech specs" page is where I spend most of my time on this challenge. This page has an embedded radar chart using Chart.js. Pushing my limits I wanted to show how our battery compares to other Lithium Ion Batteries. Stepping out of my comfort zone and applying custom graphs that are overlayed with toggleability to mix and match comparability.
